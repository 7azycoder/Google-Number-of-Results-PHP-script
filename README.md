# Google-Number-of-Results-PHP-script
This is a simple few lines script that fetches the no of results found by google search for a particular search term. Type the name in simple textbox and click 'Check' button. The script will return the no of results found on google. This script was written for one of my projects. I felt someone may need it, so i uploaded it here.
